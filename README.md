<h2>AIM:</h2> <br>
<h3>
  We are working on developing a personalized voice assistance with python which have these charecteristics:
  <ul>
    <li> Once the assistance was on it will not stop untill we stop it. </li>
    <li> This assistance will answer our question in the form of speech.</li>
    <li> As the program will gonna run all the time it is nessecery to detect weather what speacker is saying somthing it is really a question or not.<br> For an example the program is running and the speaker says I had done it then it is not an question so program has no need to response on that but on the other hand if the speaker says what is india's capital? then the program should answer on that again there could be one more situation where speaker just solving some problem and he just said somthing like "what could be it's answer?" the response will be like "what is the problem you can ask me."</li>
  </ul>
