<h2>This program can't run by python 3.13.0 version. So I decide to find another way i.e.</h2>
<b>First:</b> I had installed python 3.11.3 version .<br>
<b>Second:</b> In vs code I had changed the python interpreter from version 3.13.0 to 3.11.3.<br>
<b>Third:</b> Then I had installed several modules i.e. "SpeechRecognition" and "pyaudio" with the pip install command.<br>
<b>Forth:</b> Then simply run the program.<br>
